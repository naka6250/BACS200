            Beyonce presents the reality and states "Despite progress over the last several decades, women and girsl remain the majority of the world's unhealthy, unfed, and unpaid." Not only does Beyonce prouce great music, but she also is an advocate speaker for women and the black community. I remember being a young girl in my bedroom and just dancing to her music, while feeling like I could do anything.
