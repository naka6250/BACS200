                                In 1982, John White's vision of a local food bank was one step closer to reality when the Good Samaritan Law governing food donations passed the State Legislature. The law encouraged the donation of unmarketable products by protecting donors from liability except in cases of gross negligence or wanton acts. To our knowledge no person has ever become ill from dontated food bank products. 
                                        
                                In May of 1983, John, along with a well-connected local truck driver named Ron Keith, opened a small warehouse on Sand Island that became Hawaii Foodbank. All the equipment used was dontated by local companies and included two refrigerated containers, a flatbed truck and a three-ton forklift. By the end of their first year Hawaii Foodbank has grown exponentially over these years and is the reason they have been so successful when making an impact to the Hawaii community.
